## GitHub Pages

This repository is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using Jekyll. The deployment is handled by a GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Triggers on every push to the `main` branch
- Builds the Jekyll site
- Deploys to GitHub Pages

The published site is available at: `https://mkopnsrc.github.io/Tips-and-Tricks-Docs/`

### How It Works

The deployment uses the [Jekyll GitHub Pages workflow](.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml) which:
1. Checks out the repository
2. Configures GitHub Pages
3. Builds the site with Jekyll
4. Uploads the built site as an artifact
5. Deploys to GitHub Pages environment
